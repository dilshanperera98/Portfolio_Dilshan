The objective was to integrate AWS services, manage data efficiently, and perform SQL-based analytics. The process involved creating and configuring a Redshift cluster, setting up IAM roles with necessary permissions, and uploading data from Amazon S3 buckets. I created structured tables for the data warehouse, including tables such as <code>part</code>, <code>supplier</code>, and <code>dwdate</code>, and used the <code>COPY</code> command to load data into Redshift. SQL queries were then executed to analyze and generate insights from the data. This project provided valuable hands-on experience with AWS Redshift, S3, and IAM, while enhancing my skills in data warehouse setup, data loading, and performing analytics through SQL queries.</p>",

Triggers were used to automate job execution based on schedules or events. Key challenges included schema mapping, ETL debugging, and managing access permissions. The project improved my expertise in cloud-based ETL, AWS Glue automation, and data pipeline optimization.</p>",
